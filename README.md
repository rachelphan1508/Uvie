# Uvie

A social media app for Movie lovers to talk about their favorite movies. Users can currently create an account, make a post and upvote/downvote posts. The app is built with React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB and Express.

The web app is deployed at https://uvie.netlify.app/, the backend is hosted on Heroku and the database is managed with MongoDB. Because the backend and frontend are hosted in different places, it takes a while to load the post feed when you access the website.
